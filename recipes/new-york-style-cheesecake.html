        <h2><em>Description:</em></h2>
        <p>This New York cheesecake is <strong><em>dense</em></strong> and <strong><em>rich</em></strong>. It includes a great technique for letting the cheesecake finish in the oven so that <strong>no cracks</strong> form as the cake cools. It's a favorite dessert of mine served with my fresh strawberry sauce.</p>
        <p>New York-style cheesecake is <strong><em>larger</em></strong> and <strong><em>richer</em></strong> than traditional cheesecake, thanks to the additions of cream cheese and more egg yolks. Some recipes, like this one, feature sour cream to make the dessert even more decadent. </p>
        <h2><em>Ingredients:</em></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <em>For the crust:</em>
                <ul>
                    <li>18 graham crackers, crushed</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons melted butter</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>For the filling:</em>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
                    <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese</li>
                    <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
                    <li>⅔ cup milk</li>
                    <li>4 large eggs</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><em>Steps:</em></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan.</li>
            <li>Mix graham cracker crumbs and melted butter together in a bowl until evenly moistened. Press crumb mixture into the bottom and about 1/2 inch up the sides of the springform pan.</li>
            <li>Whisk sour cream, flour, and vanilla extract together in a bowl; set aside.</li>
            <li>Stir cream cheese and sugar together with a wooden spoon in a separate bowl until evenly incorporated, 3 to 5 minutes; add milk and whisk until just combined. Whisk in eggs, one at a time, stirring well after each addition. Stir in lemon zest, orange zest, and sour cream mixture; whisk until just incorporated. Pour mixture into prepared springform pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the edges have nicely puffed and the surface of the cheesecake is firm except for a small spot in the center that will jiggle when the pan is gently shaken, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>When the cheesecake is done, turn off the oven and let it cool in the oven for 3 to 4 hours. This prevents any cracks from forming on the top of the cheesecake.</li>
        </ol>
